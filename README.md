### Overview
This project is a sticky note application built written in Java. The goal of this project was to learn and practice software development principles and methodology. Our team followed the Agile Scrum methology for this project.

The user is able to create and save notes using this application. The notes can be assigned a date, time, and completion status. The dashboard will give the user an overview of their notes upon opening the application showing any upcoming notes and notes marked as incomplete. In note board, the user is able to create and edit notes, as well as sort and search through their notes. The user is also able to recycle notes which will send them to an archive. In the archive, the user is able to restore any notes that they may previously deleted or permanently delete notes. The application exports all of the user's notes upon closing the application to a .dat file and reads the object data from the .dat file upon opening the application.
